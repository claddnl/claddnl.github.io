## a loosely structured personal blog
 
In lieu of an 'about' page, and in the spirit of the current, here is what I am currently working on, thinking about, seeking, reading, listening to, writing etc. 

This year I am a fellowship candidate at Newspeak House, an *‘independent residential college founded in 2015 to study, nurture and inspire emerging communities of practice across civil society and the public sector in the UK’* and so I expect this will shape much of my thinking and approach over the current year. I’m still narrowing down a problem to work on, and am very open to input and ideas.

In the shorter term though: 

**Working on**: Amendments various pieces of legislation (the data bill, the employment rights bill, etc) that allow for better conditions for workers across the UK. 

**Thinking about**: US General Election Results.

**Doing**: Organising a hackathon - no public details yet, but coming soon.

**Seeking**: Looking to talk to someone who has thought in depth about the structural vs quick wins policing conundrum, and how to deal with some of the perverse incentives that drive it. ([more here re county lines gangs](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2023.2223341); see also: Londons phone theft problems treatment as a petty crime issue, [despite the organised crime that drives it](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cybersecurity-expert-reveals-why-more-more-stolen-phones-london-are-ending-china-1726329) [and particularly re the latter: why are the data gaps so large?])

**Reading**: Kleptopia: How Dirty Money is Capturing the World by Tom Burgis

Dark Data: Why what you don't know matters by David J. Hand

**Listening to**: Sick Parade: A crisis at Catterick Garrison, by Tortoise media.

**Writing**: A long-form piece on long term illness and Britain’s productivity puzzle (prompted, in part, by a recent rereading of [this Guardian piece](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/24/500000-under-35s-out-of-work-long-term-illness-uk) from earlier this year)

**Watching**: Nothing! Attempting a screen free ~month~ (or at least, until the next ep of Love is Blind drops)
