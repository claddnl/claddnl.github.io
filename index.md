## A loosely structured personal blog
 
In lieu of an 'about' page, and in the spirit of the current, here is what I am currently working on, thinking about, seeking, reading, listening to, writing etc. You can find an archive of previous ‘now’ updates, gathering dust, here.

This year I am a fellowship candidate at Newspeak House, an ‘independent residential college founded in 2015 to study, nurture and inspire emerging communities of practice across civil society and the public sector in the UK’ and so I expect this will shape much of my thinking and approach over the current year. I’m still narrowing down a problem to work on, and am very open to input and ideas.

In the shorter term though: 

Working on: The Employment Rights Bill - thinking this week about gaps, opportunities, cross-departmental potential, and the eternal curse of Britain’s obsession with consultations.

Thinking about: The unseen impacts of Britain's openness to dirty money.

Doing: Attending the RTAU’s Fairness Challenge showcase (hmu if you’re also going)

Seeking: Looking to talk to someone who has thought in depth about the structural vs quick wins policing conundrum, and how to deal with some of the perverse incentives that drive it. ([more here re county lines gangs](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2023.2223341); see also: Londons phone theft problems treatment as a petty crime issue, [despite the organised crime that drives it](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cybersecurity-expert-reveals-why-more-more-stolen-phones-london-are-ending-china-1726329) [and particularly re the latter: why are the data gaps so large?]

Reading: Kleptopia: How Dirty Money is Capturing the World by Tom Burgis

Listening to: [The Kill List, by Wondery](https://wondery.com/shows/kill-list/). 

Writing: A long-form piece on long term illness and Britain’s productivity puzzle (prompted, in part, by a recent rereading of [this Guardian piece](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/24/500000-under-35s-out-of-work-long-term-illness-uk) from earlier this year)
