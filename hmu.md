I’m a notorious yapper and proactively consider talking to people about things they’re interested in to be a legitimate hobby - if you’re working on something cool, think I’m working on something cool, or think it might make sense for us both to work on something cool together, then you can reach out via any of the following channels. (Alternatively, if you’re doing none of the above but would like to talk about RHOBH or any other trashy reality TV show then that works too. I’m not that picky)
